### The motivation:
<div>
  This project is made thinking in my college team of FSAE, the objective is to help search the prices of tires in the market, make it easier to see how much money that we   expect to spend on it.

<b>About the project:</b>
<div>
  It's a normal web scraping, paste the  site information for a CSV file(the site https://www.pneustore.com.br/)
</div>
<br>

<b>My perspective:</b>
<div>
  That's the first try to do a webscrapping(I expect this code gonna be useful for somebody =)), the most difficult part for me is in the fact that in most videos that I saw, the websites that they use don't have the tags <script>, it's make the work harder, but I tried my best. If anyone  have a better way to do that contac me in my linkedin(profile) or my email: Pedro.Lopesverardo@gmail.com.
